        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="regular">
            Chicken Katsu is a crispy yet tender panko-covered cutlet
            served with tonkatsu sauce and a side of shredded cabbage
            salad. They are fun to bulk-prep and freeze or add into
            your meal prep.
        </p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Serves: 2</strong></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tbs all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp neutral oil (egg mix)</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>3 cups neutral oil (deep frying)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the breading station with 3 bowls. 1 - 
                flour, 2 - egg and oil whisked together (to prevent
                meat and breading from separating), 3 - panko.</li>
            <li>Butterfly the chicken, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the 3 cups oil in a medium, heavy-bottom pot on
                medium-low to low heat until it reaches 340Â°F.
                The oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken with the flour, shake off excess.
                Do the same with the egg, then press panko on before
                shaking off the excess.</li>
            <li>On medium heat, deep-fry the breaded chicken for
                3 minutes total, flipping once midway, until
                golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Remove and hold vertically over the pot to drain
                excess oil. Transfer to a wire rack or paper-lined tray.
                Keep it on its side to drain even more excess oil.</li>
            <li>Collect crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh skimmer
                before frying the next piece, to prevent burning and
                keep the oil clean.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and serve with a 
                tonkatsu sauce dipping, shredded cabbage and sesame
                dressing, and wedges of tomato for colour.</li>

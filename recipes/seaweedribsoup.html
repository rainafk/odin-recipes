        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Seaweed and Rib soup is a staple Chinese pork bone soup.
            Using ribs gives less fat and produces a lighter flavour,
            and dried seaweed gives umami. This can be served as a side
            to contrast with hot sesame noodles, buns or steamed rice.
        </p>
        <p>Note: Recommend using a pressure cooker so it can simmer on a
            low heat with less time needed for a clean and light soup taste.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>80g dried seaweed / kelp (hydrated)</li>

            <li>500g pork ribs (chopped into bite-sized pieces)</li>
            <li>green onion (knotted)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pot of water until boiling, then put the ribs
